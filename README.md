# hogwarts_enrollment
# I am planning to do a hogwarts enrollment for first years. It is a site with information for classes, rooms where the classes are located and the teachers teaching the class. I did the first weeks workshop because I thought we were supposed to do the entrie thing. I have the docker file but its the tutorials and users.
